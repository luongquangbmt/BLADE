band: 300-700 MHZ
Width: 60 - 80 degrees
Impedance matching : 50 Ohm instead of 100
Gap between the antenna and director mesh: dieletric ?
simulate & optimize tube sizes using commercially available tubes
Angle between two rods
LNA on top of the rods
forgot to ask: no need for balun ?
Antenna will be tilted ~10-15o to ovelap with the beam of the main array in Taiwan
