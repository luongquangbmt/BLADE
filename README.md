# BLADE
 Broadband Low-frequency Astronomical Detection Experiment (BLADE)

BLADE is a radio astronomy instrument designed to observe the Universe in the 300–800 MHz band, a rich and underexplored window into the low-frequency radio sky. Operating with wide spectral coverage and high sensitivity, BLADE targets a broad range of astrophysical phenomena — including pulsars, galactic synchrotron emission, fast radio transients, and signatures of the early Universe.

By combining a compact, scalable design with modern digital back-ends, BLADE enables high time-resolution and spectrally resolved observations, making it ideal for both survey science and targeted monitoring. Its architecture emphasizes low-noise performance and modularity, paving the way for deployment in remote, radio-quiet environments.
